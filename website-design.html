            <h1 class="xl-heading">Website Design</h1>
            <p class="medium-heading">When designing websites, I have a very specific and organized process.
                I use tools from the Adobe create suite like Illustrator and Photoshop
                to create intriguing graphics, and Lightroom to bring images to life. I
                also use Procreate plan sites and digitize illustrations. 
                
                <br><br>With clients, my main goal is to create a site that matches
                their needs as well as their brand and identity. I begin this process
                by consulting with clients and finding out what they are looking for. 
                I dive into who they are as a company or group and develop a concept for 
                their site and move on to building it. If needed, I will go onsite and 
                take pictures for the website, like I did with Saxton Falls Sand and Gravel. 
                Throughout the entire process, I consult with the client to ensure I am 
                meeting their vision.
            </p>
            <br><h3 class= "medium-heading">Below are some, examples of work I have done. 
                I also designed this entire site using Illustrator, Photoshop, and VS Code!</h3>
