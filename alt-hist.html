                This was my a project for Introduction to Photoshop and Illustrator. The prompt
                asked for us to question what would be different if significant events happened
                in another way, or didn't even happen at all. We had to change history using Photoshop
                and the skills we were learning in class, like masks, adjustment layers, and adding 
                grain. As someone that loves to watch movies and TV shows, I chose to reimagine the 
                casting of classic movies. Many movies had multiple big name (sometimes future big name)
                actors and actresses audition for an iconic role, and I was curious as to how that would
                change modern celebrity and media culture. To show this, I edited other actors and
                actresses that were considered for a role onto a movie's poster.
