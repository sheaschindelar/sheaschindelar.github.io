            <h1 class="xl-heading">Social Media for the Acoustics</h1>
            <p class="medium-heading"> I was elected as Social Media and Marketing Coordinator for the Boston College
                Acoustics in March of 2023. In this role, I have the responsibility of managing
                our social media platforms, like Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube, organizing
                media days, running our website, and managing promotional aspects of our performances, 
                like designing posters, renting video cameras to record the performace, hiring 
                a photographer, and livestreaming the performaces. I work alongside my other Co-Pub, 
                Tessa Burke, and together we ensure that the best possible image of our group is put 
                forward. While Tessa takes on more logistical tasks like uploading our shows to YouTube,
                scheduling posts, and writing post captions, I work on the technical aspects of this job, 
                like designing and maintaining the website, creating flyers, recording shows, and 
                creating and editing content for our social media. <br><br>

            <p class="medium-heading">I have found that my interests in technology and art have blended seamlessly 
                in this role, and the skills I have learned in both art and computer science classes have helped 
                me immensley to create better content for the group. For example, when redesigning our website,
                I was able to improve its functionality by applying topics I was learning in a web 
                design course and improved its look by using what I had learned in a digital design course.
                What I have learned about Adobe Illustrator and related Adobe products has helped me create
                more personalized and unique content for our social media, rather than using ready-made templates.
                I have used art and technology to expand our content online has enhanced our group to 
                stand out on campus. Through my continuing education in art and technology, I've not only 
                elevated our online presence but also reinforced our group's distinct identity at Boston College.

            <p class = "medium-heading">When I became Social Media and Marketing manager, part of my responsibility
                was running our website. The previous site was outdated, and it was difficult to see who we are 
                as a group through it. At the beginning of 2024, I took on the task of redesigning the website after I
                began taking a class on website design. Using Wix, I was able to develop a improved website that 
                looks professional and fits our brand by focusing on using quality images and a cohesive color pallette
                and fonts. I also imporved usability of the website by simplifying our pages and our menu.
